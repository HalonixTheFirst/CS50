sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
The following are times taken by the algorithm:
Random5000: 0.063s
Random50000: 6.881s
Reversed5000: 0.064s
Reversed50000: 5.494s
From these times we can guess that since the times only drastically vary with size and not with order of input, which suggests a bubble sort algorithm.


sort2 uses:Merge Sort
How do you know?:
The following are times taken by the algorithm:
Random5000: 0.021s
Random50000: 0.928s;
Reversed5000: 0.021s
Reversed50000: 1.076s

From these times we can conclude that changing the input has minimal effect on the time taken so it must be nlogn(Merge Sort).

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
The following are times taken by the algorithm:

Random5000: 0.038s
random50000: 2.775s
Reversed5000: 0.042s
Reversed50000: 2.880s

This shows that the reversed inputs take the most time which is also the worst case for the Selection Sort Algorithm.
